## Abstract<a name="motivation"></a>

This research explores savings behaviour of households living in South African metropolitan townships and their ability to manage financial shocks such as the death of the breadwinner or a natural disaster. In particular, we want to determine if mobile money solutions (“save anywhere, anytime”) augmented or replaced community savings schemes like stokvels and more traditional ones like funeral plans, insurance and bank accounts; and if it improved households’ shock coping strategies. We interviewed 528 households in the Metropolitan Township of Khayelitsha, Cape Town and found statistical evidence that employment status, education level and approach to life influence savings behaviour and adoption of an “optimal” vs. “sub-optimal” strategy when facing unexpected events or shocks.

## Conclusions<a name="conclusions"></a>
The ten retention factors most sought by engineers working in Eskom power plants are, in sequence from 1 (most important) to 10:
1. Career Advancement Opportunities
2. Remuneration
3. Job Satisfaction
4. Resources to perform work
5. Challenging work
6. Leadership Development
7. Recognition
8. Freedom to work independently
9. Co-worker relationships
10. Performance related rewards
Thus, to improve the retention rate of the engineers at the power stations, the organisation and industry should create mechanisms to meet these priorities, and tailor them to individuals where possible.
