## Abstract<a name="motivation"></a>

This research explores savings behaviour of households living in South African metropolitan townships and their ability to manage financial shocks such as the death of the breadwinner or a natural disaster. In particular, we want to determine if mobile money solutions (“save anywhere, anytime”) augmented or replaced community savings schemes like stokvels and more traditional ones like funeral plans, insurance and bank accounts; and if it improved households’ shock coping strategies. 

We interviewed 528 households in the Metropolitan Township of Khayelitsha, Cape Town and found statistical evidence that employment status, education level and approach to life influence savings behaviour and adoption of an “optimal” vs. “sub-optimal” strategy when facing unexpected events or shocks.

## Conclusions<a name="conclusions"></a>
In this rsearch we report the results of the interviews of 528 households in Khayelitsha, Cape Town in order to understand their savings behaviour and their ability to manage unexpected events or shocks after their occurrence. We investigated usage of different savings instruments from bank accounts, to community based savings schemes like stokvels and funeral plans to technology-based instruments like mobile money solutions. We organised our study around some key aspects in order to determine how savings behaviour is affected by the respondents’ approach to life, educational level, and employment status.

Cell phone usage is mainly for calls and messaging, with only 15% declaring using the phone for MM. FNB’s eWallet is by far the most popular mobile money offering (44%). However, frequency of usage is very low, as almost half of the respondents admit they use it only once a month. This is in line with expectations as most employed respondents choose to put some money aside when they receive their salaries. Those ones who use the phone for mobile money, however, keep healthy balances in it at the end of the month, with 45% indicating a balance of R500 or more. A large %age indicates the product allows them to save more and more frequently. Safety risk is reported as the main reason for mobile money non-usage.

Bank accounts are the main tool used to save, confirming data from other research such as Ikapadata (2012), who showed that up to 80% of the population in the area is banked. However, other popular savings methods include stokvels (33%), funeral plans (30%) and cash in a safe place (21%).

Unexpected events affect spending behaviour, with opening a bank account and having children being predominant. A distinction was made between events that have been initiated by the respondent or in which the respondent has full control, such as opening a bank account, joining a stokvel, getting insurance, as opposed to external events that are non- controllable or less-controllable such as rising food prices, having children, experiencing a loss in the family. Correlation tests showed that intentional events are much more significant in affecting savings behaviour than unintentional events.

When shock coping behaviour was classified into three strategies: “Optimal”, “Sub-optimal” and “Neutral”, it was found that 57% of households adopted a sub-optimal strategy while 31% adopted an optimal strategy. In answer to the initial research questions, correlation tests showed statistically significant relationships between better strategies and employment status but, surprisingly not with education level or attitude towards life (as measured with a hedonistic scale as well as ‘save-versus-spend’ attitude). In addition, it was found that respondents who use other saving methods besides a bank account adopt better strategies. In particular, 50% of respondents who adopted an optimal strategy use stokvels, 50% use insurance/funeral plans, and 60% use cash in a safe place, as compared to 41% using bank accounts. Although this may sound counter-intuitive, money saved through forms of insurance like funeral plans or stokvels is not available for withdrawal anytime and therefore is more suitable when facing certain specific shocks, like a funeral plan in case of the death of an household member.
Although all the respondents who use some MM product indicated that they perceive an improvement in their ability to deal with unexpected events, the numbers of MM users were too small to draw meaningful statistical conclusions. Similarly 97% of respondents who save using stokvels or other methods perceived an improvement.
